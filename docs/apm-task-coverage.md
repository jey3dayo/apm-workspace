# APM Task Coverage

## Operational Contract

- `~/.apm` is the day-to-day source of truth for APM catalog content, task wiring, and supporting docs.
- `~/.config` is reference-only for this workflow. It is not the operational source of truth.
- The only allowed operational exception under `~/.config` is `~/.config/scripts/replace-bold-headings.ts`, which exists as a formatter helper for heading normalization.
- Codex guidance is handled as a compile target via `apm compile --target codex --output ~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
- Codex skills deploy separately to `~/.agents/skills`; skill rollout verification must inspect the deployed `SKILL.md` there.

## Source Of Truth

- `~/.apm/catalog/skills/**`: personal skills
- `~/.apm/optional-skills/.apm/skills/**`: repository-scoped optional skills; tracked here but not included in the global rollout
- `~/.apm/optional-skills/apm.yml`: standalone optional package manifest
- `~/.apm/catalog/{AGENTS.md,agents/**,commands/**,rules/**}`: shared guidance
- `~/.apm/apm.yml`, `~/.apm/apm.lock.yaml`: dependency selection and accepted upstream state
- `~/.apm/.apm/skills/**`: APM workspace-only skill source for skills intentionally excluded from global rollout
- `~/.apm/.claude/skills/**`, `~/.apm/.agents/skills/**`: project runtime bridges; child skill directories symlink to the workspace-only source
- `~/.apm/apm_modules/`: cache only

## Optional Skill Contract

- `optional-skills` is not listed in the root `apm.yml` and is never installed by the global `mise run deploy` flow.
- A consuming repository adds `jey3dayo/apm-workspace/optional-skills#main` to its own `apm.yml` and selects the required skill with `apm install --skill <id>`.
- An optional skill that is already part of an upstream bundle remains owned by that upstream package. Select it in the consuming repository with the upstream package ref and `--skill <id>` rather than copying it into this workspace.

## APM Workspace-only Skill Contract

- Keep workspace-only skill content under `.apm/skills/<id>/`.
- Do not add workspace-only skills to root `apm.yml` or `apm.lock.yaml`; they must not be included in the global APM rollout.
- Keep `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` as real directories and symlink each skill directory to `.apm/skills/<id>/`.
- Do not symlink the entire `.agents/skills` root or only `SKILL.md`; the skill directory is the unit of distribution.
- Runtime checks must verify both symlink targets and the source `SKILL.md`.
