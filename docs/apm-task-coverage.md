# APM Task Coverage

## Operational Contract

- `~/.apm` is the day-to-day source of truth for APM catalog content, task wiring, and supporting docs.
- `~/.config` is bootstrap-only. It may be used to start or maintain the local APM environment, but it is not the operational source of truth.
- The only allowed operational exception under `~/.config` is `~/.config/scripts/replace-bold-headings.ts`, which exists as a formatter helper for heading normalization.
- `~/.config/nix/agent-skills-sources.nix` is retired and intentionally empty because external skill sources were removed.

## Where Content Lives

| Content area           | Current source of truth                      | Notes                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `skills`               | `~/.apm/catalog/skills/**`                   | Personal skill authoring source        |
| `agents`               | `~/.apm/catalog/agents/**`                   | Runtime sync target                    |
| top-level `commands/`  | `~/.apm/catalog/commands/**`                 | Runtime sync target                    |
| `rules`                | `~/.apm/catalog/rules/**`                    | Runtime sync target                    |
| `AGENTS.md`            | `~/.apm/catalog/AGENTS.md`                   | Managed catalog instructions           |
| formatter helper       | `~/.config/scripts/replace-bold-headings.ts` | Allowed bootstrap/helper exception     |
| retired skills sources | `~/.config/nix/agent-skills-sources.nix`     | Intentionally empty; do not repopulate |

## Acceptance Criteria

This migration slice is complete only when all of the following are true:

1. `mise.toml` task entries do not call `~/.config/scripts/apm-workspace` or any equivalent bootstrap script path.
2. `README.md`, `llms.md`, and `docs/apm-task-coverage.md` do not reference the retired bootstrap docs subtree.
3. The only allowed operational exception under `~/.config` is `~/.config/scripts/replace-bold-headings.ts`, and this document names it explicitly.
4. `~/.config/nix/agent-skills-sources.nix` remains retired and intentionally empty, with no external skill source definitions restored there.
5. The task coverage above continues to map operational work to `~/.apm` as the source of truth.

## Notes

- This document is a current operating contract, not a migration log.
- Existing coverage remains useful only insofar as it explains how the `mise` tasks operate from `~/.apm`.
